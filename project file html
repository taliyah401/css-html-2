<h1>
 I'm not that interested in computer science because I don't understand anything.
  The experince that I have in computer science is just some things I've done in 7th grade and up.
  
  I am not a fan of Industry Prep because it's just a concept that I will never understand.
  
  I need to know code in order to make a buisness website for myself.
  
  I want to persue a career having to do with making my own buisness.
